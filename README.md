# NADRA-HQ-Data-Science-Internship

This repository contains tutorials for learning the basics of LangChain and 3 projects made using the LangChain framework.

In order to successfully run the projects, the use of environment variables is required. You need to store the environment variables in a `.env` file. Follow the instructions below.

## Setting Up Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of this repository.

2. Inside the `.env` file, define the following variables:

   ```env
   # OpenAI API Key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

   # Pinecone API Key
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key

   # Pinecone Environment
   PINECONE_ENV=your_pinecone_env

Replace your_openai_api_key, your_pinecone_api_key, and your_pinecone_env with your actual API keys and environment information. Keep this information secure and do not share it publicly.
