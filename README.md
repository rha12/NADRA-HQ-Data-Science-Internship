# NADRA-HQ-Data-Science-Internship

This repository contains tutorials for learning the basics of LangChain and features three projects developed using the LangChain framework. These materials encompass the knowledge and experiences I gained during my internship at NADRA HQ, where I was an integral part of the data science team.

## Repository Contents

1. **Tutorials**: A series of tutorials designed to help you grasp the fundamentals of LangChain. These tutorials are ideal for beginners looking to understand the framework.

2. **Projects**: Three practical projects that demonstrate the real-world applications of LangChain. Each project is a result of collaborative efforts within the data science team during my internship.

## About My Internship

During my time at NADRA HQ, I had the privilege of working as a member of the data science team. The experience I gained while contributing to these projects has been invaluable in my journey to becoming proficient with LangChain and data science techniques.
## How To Run The Projects
In order to successfully run the projects, the use of environment variables is required. You need to store the environment variables in a `.env` file. Follow the instructions below.

## Setting Up Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of this repository.

2. Inside the `.env` file, define the following variables:

   ```env
   # OpenAI API Key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

   # Pinecone API Key
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key

   # Pinecone Environment
   PINECONE_ENV=your_pinecone_env

Replace your_openai_api_key, your_pinecone_api_key, and your_pinecone_env with your actual API keys and environment information. Keep this information secure and do not share it publicly.
